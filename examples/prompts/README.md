## Prompt Snippets (for MCP‑aware assistants)

These are natural‑language prompts you can paste into an MCP‑enabled assistant (e.g., Codex) to drive the `simplecov-mcp` server tools. Adjust file paths to your project.

Tips

- If not specified, tools run with `root = .` and default resultset discovery. Mention a custom resultset only when needed.
- Ask for JSON when you want machine‑readable output; otherwise request a concise human summary.

Files in this folder are plain text you can copy into your chat.
