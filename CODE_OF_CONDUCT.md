# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and users pledge to make participation in this
project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others  
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
* Taking responsibility for our mistakes and learning from them  
* Focusing on what is best for the community, not just ourselves  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances  
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
* Public or private harassment  
* Publishing others’ private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission  
* Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported through GitHub’s [Report Abuse form](https://github.com/contact/report-abuse).

If inappropriate behavior occurs in this repository’s issues, pull requests,
or discussions, the maintainer may delete comments, lock threads, or block
offending users from further participation.

These actions are at the sole discretion of the maintainer and are intended to
maintain a safe, respectful, and productive environment for everyone.
