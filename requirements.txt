# Documentation build dependencies (OPTIONAL - only needed for building docs)
# These are NOT required for using cov-loupe as a gem or MCP server.
#
# For contributors: Install any version within these ranges to build docs locally.
# For CI: Use requirements-lock.txt for reproducible builds (see dev/prompts/ai-code-evaluator-guidelines.md).
#
# NOTE: Docs CI pins Python 3.12 because mkdocs-include-markdown-plugin
# does not yet ship wheels compatible with Python 3.13.
