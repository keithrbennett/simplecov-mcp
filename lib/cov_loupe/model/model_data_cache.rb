module CovLoupe
  # Thread-safe singleton cache for ModelData instances.
  # Entries are keyed by [resultset_path, root] and automatically invalidated when the file changes.
  #
  # Cache invalidation uses a two-layer check:
  #   1. Signature: file mtime + size + inode (cheap, no file read)
  #   2. Digest: MD5 hash of file contents (catches same-mtime edits on coarse-grained filesystems)
  #
  # Both must match for a cache hit. If either differs, fresh data is loaded.
  #
  # The cache key includes both resultset_path and root because path normalization and
  # case-sensitivity detection depend on the root directory. Two models with the same
  # resultset but different roots may have different normalized coverage maps.
  #
  # Why a singleton? CoverageModel instances are lightweight (created per request in MCP mode),
  # but loading and normalizing the resultset is expensive. The singleton cache ensures that
  # repeated requests for the same resultset reuse the parsed data until the file changes.
  class ModelDataCache
    # Mutex for thread-safe singleton initialization.
    # Using a constant ensures it cannot be reset, avoiding race conditions in JRuby.

    # @note Complexity: O(1) amortized for cache hits. For cache misses, O(n) where n
    #   is the size of the resultset file, plus O(m) for parsing where m is total lines.
    #   File stat and MD5 digest are O(1) relative to file size on most filesystems.
    # @note Thread-safety: Thread-safe. This method uses a Mutex to synchronize access
    #   to the internal cache entries hash. Concurrent calls from multiple threads
    #   are guaranteed to return consistent results without data races.
