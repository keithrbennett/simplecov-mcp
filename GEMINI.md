# Refer to AGENTS.md

For detailed instructions on using Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and related agents in this repo, read @AGENTS.md first.

When you identify the need to add or expand instructions about how to use these tools, make those additions in @AGENTS.md rather than here, and treat this file as a high-level pointer.
