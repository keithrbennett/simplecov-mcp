Study the documentation in *.md, docs/user/**/*.md, and docs/dev/**/*.md, and give me an outline of a short (2-5 minute) screencast showcasing the functionality of this gem. It should
include substantial coverage of AI prompts that use `cov-loupe` to deeply reason about test coverage in useful ways.

In the process of doing this, try to find some amazing use cases for this gem; things we can put in the screencast 
and in docs that will really illustrate how valuable this tool is, as opposed to just asking a model to analyze
the .resultset.json file itself.
