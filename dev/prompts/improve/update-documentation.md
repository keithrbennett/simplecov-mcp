# Review and Revise Documentation as Necessary

**Purpose:** Keep the project's Markdown documentation accurate, clear, complete, and internally consistent.

## Scope

Examine all Markdown files in:

- `*.md`
- `docs/**/*.md`
- `docs/user/**/*.md`
- `docs/dev/arch-decisions/**/*.md`

## What to Look For

### Accuracy

- Claims that no longer match the code (CLI flags, method names, output formats, file paths).
- Code examples that produce different output than documented, or that refer to removed features.
- Version numbers, dependency names, or configuration keys that have changed.

### Clarity

- Sections that assume prior knowledge not provided in the doc or a clearly-linked prerequisite.
- Ambiguous pronouns or unexplained jargon — if the meaning is unclear on first read, rewrite it.
- Paragraphs that mix distinct topics; split or reorganise them.
- Over-long explanations where a concise rewrite would preserve meaning with less noise.

### Completeness

- Missing prerequisites: if a command requires setup, the setup must be described or linked.
- Gaps between what a feature does and what the docs say it does.
- New CLI subcommands, MCP tools, or options not yet documented.

### Link Integrity

Check internal links (relative Markdown paths) and anchor links (`#heading-id`):

- Verify that the target file exists at the referenced path.
- Verify that named anchors (`#section-name`) match an actual heading in the target document.
- Check that bidirectional navigation links exist where expected (e.g., a top-level README links
  to a specialist doc, and that doc links back with `[Back to main README](...)`).

### Duplication

- If the same point is explained in multiple documents, decide which is the canonical location
  and replace the others with a brief note and a link to it.
- Do not duplicate content that is already maintained elsewhere — link instead.

### Code Examples

- Confirm that shell/CLI examples use current flag names and produce valid output.
- For thorough validation of all runnable examples across the docs, use
  [`dev/prompts/validate/test-documentation-examples.md`](../validate/test-documentation-examples.md).

## Special Cases

### MkDocs Include-Markdown Stubs

Some files under `docs/` are intentional single-line stubs that use the MkDocs
`include-markdown` plugin to pull in content from the repository root. Do **not**
flag these as incomplete. See
[`dev/prompts/guidelines/ai-code-evaluator-guidelines.md` — MkDocs Include-Markdown Stubs](../guidelines/ai-code-evaluator-guidelines.md#mkdocs-include-markdown-stubs)
for the full explanation.

## Actions to Take

1. **Fix in place** — edit the doc file directly; no separate report is needed unless the scope
   of changes warrants a summary.
2. **Prefer linking over duplicating** — when the same information belongs in two places, keep
   the authoritative copy and add a short cross-reference elsewhere.
3. **Match existing tone** — keep edits consistent with the surrounding prose style.
4. **Do not rewrite for rewriting's sake** — only change what is inaccurate, unclear, or missing.

## Constraints

- Do not alter code files unless a documented example is genuinely broken and a code fix is
  clearly correct; prefer updating the docs to match current behaviour.
- Do not run `git commit`. Stage only the documentation files you changed, and propose a concise
  commit message describing what was corrected and why.
