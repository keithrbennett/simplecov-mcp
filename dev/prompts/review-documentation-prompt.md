# Review and Revise Documentation as Necessary

Look at the documentation *.md files in the project's  *.md, docs/user/**/*.md, and docs/dev/**/*.md, examine the code base, and make any changes necessary to the documentation accordingly.

The code base has been under much development and the docs may not yet reflect the changes.

Also, make sure that documents are linked in both directions, e.g. from the top level readme
to the specialized document, and vice versa.
