# Review and Revise Documentation as Necessary

Examine carefully the Markdown documentation files in:

- *.md
- docs/**/*.md
- docs/user/**/*.md
- docs/dev/arch-decisions/**/*.md

Make any changes necessary to make them accurate, clear, and complete.

Make sure that documents are linked in both directions, e.g. from the top level readme
to the specialized document, and vice versa.

Ensure that there is enough verbiage to explain a given point, but not too much as to 
unnecessarily reduce the signal to noise ratio. 

If a given point is addressed in multiple documents, look to see if that is sensible, and fix if necessary.

Ensure that any code examples are correct and relevant.
