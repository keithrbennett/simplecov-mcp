# Review and Revise Documentation as Necessary

Look at the documentation *.md files in the project's  *.md, docs/user/**/*.md, and docs/dev/**/*.md, examine the code base, and make any changes necessary to the documentation accordingly.

The code base has been under much development and the docs may not yet reflect the changes.
