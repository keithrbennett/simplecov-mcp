# Use the 'cov-loupe' application as a command line utility as a fallback to MCP server mode.

[Back to main README](../../index.md)

The `cov-loupe` application provides precise test coverage information for your Ruby application.

It reads the `.resultset.json` file generated by SimpleCov, and offers multiple ways to analyze and display its information.

Ideally it will be configured as an MCP server, but if it is not, or if there are errors accessing it as an MCP server,
then it can also be accessed as a terminal command (CLI).

Run `cov-loupe --help` to get up to date information about usage, options, etc.
