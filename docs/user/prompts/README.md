# Prompt Library

[Back to main README](../../index.md)

Starter prompts you can paste into MCP-compatible assistants when you need cov-loupe to run targeted reports or fall back to CLI execution.

- [Rails Coverage Analysis](rails-coverage-analysis-prompt.md) – Guide an assistant through triaging a Rails `.resultset.json`
- [Non-Web Coverage Analysis](non-web-coverage-analysis-prompt.md) – Prompts for service/library repos
- [Use CLI Instead of MCP](use-cli-not-mcp-prompt.md) – Include in another prompt to instruct the model to use cov-loupe CLI as a fallback when MCP transport is blocked or unavailable
