# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the SimpleCov MCP project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures a significant architectural decision made during the development of this project, along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

### Title
A short phrase describing the decision (e.g., "Dual-Mode Operation: CLI and MCP Server")

### Status
- **Accepted**: The decision has been made and is currently in effect
- **Proposed**: Under consideration
- **Deprecated**: No longer applicable
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision

### Context
The background, problem statement, and constraints that led to this decision. This section answers "Why did we need to make a decision here?"

### Decision
The architectural decision that was made. This section answers "What did we decide to do?"

### Consequences
The implications of this decision, both positive and negative. This includes:
- Benefits gained
- Trade-offs accepted
- Complexity introduced
- Future constraints

### References
Links to related code, issues, documentation, or other ADRs.

## Index of ADRs

- [001: Dual-Mode Operation](001-x-arch-decision.md) - CLI vs MCP server mode detection
- [002: Context-Aware Error Handling](002-x-arch-decision.md) - Mode-specific error handling strategy
- [003: Coverage Staleness Detection](003-x-arch-decision.md) - Three-type staleness system

- [005: No SimpleCov Runtime Dependency](005-x-arch-decision.md) - Reading `.resultset.json` directly

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when:
- Making a decision that affects the structure or behavior of the system
- Choosing between multiple viable approaches
- Accepting significant trade-offs
- Making decisions that future maintainers should understand

## Contributing

When adding a new ADR:
1. Use the next sequential number (e.g., `006-x-arch-decision.md`)
2. Follow the format outlined above
3. Update this README's index
4. Link to relevant code and documentation
