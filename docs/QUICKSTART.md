# Quick Start

[Back to main README](index.md)

Get up and running with cov-loupe in 3 steps.

## 1. Install

```sh
gem install cov-loupe
```

## 2. Generate Coverage

Run your test suite with SimpleCov enabled:

```sh
bundle exec rspec  # or your test command
```

This creates `coverage/.resultset.json`.

## 3. View Coverage

```sh
cov-loupe
```

You'll see a table showing coverage for each file, sorted by highest coverage first (lowest at the bottom).

## Common Commands

```sh
# Check a specific file
cov-loupe summary lib/my_file.rb

# See uncovered lines
cov-loupe uncovered lib/my_file.rb

# Get overall project stats
cov-loupe totals

# View all commands
cov-loupe --help
```
