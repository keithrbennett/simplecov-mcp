# Demo project fixture

This small demo project powers the documentation examples that rely on partial coverage and tracked globs.

- Location: `docs/fixtures/demo_project`
- Resultset: `.resultset.json` in this directory
- Suggested alias for docs: `alias clp='cov-loupe --root docs/fixtures/demo_project'`

Files include controllers, models, payments services, background jobs, and an API client. A few files are intentionally missing from the resultset so the `--tracked-globs` examples surface gaps.
