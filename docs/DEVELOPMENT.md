# Development Guide

This guide is for developers who want to contribute to `simplecov-mcp`.

## Setup

Standard Ruby gem structure. After cloning:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/keithrbennett/simplecov-mcp.git
cd simplecov-mcp
bundle install
```

## Running Locally

To test your changes, you can run the executable directly from the repository:

```sh
ruby -Ilib exe/simplecov-mcp --help
```

## Running Tests

Run the full RSpec suite:

```sh
bundle exec rspec
```

This will also generate a new coverage report in `coverage/.resultset.json`, which you can then analyze with the tool itself:

```sh
# Analyze the coverage of this project
ruby -Ilib exe/simplecov-mcp

# Open the HTML report generated by SimpleCov
open coverage/index.html
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Ensure all tests pass (`bundle exec rspec`)
5. Submit a pull request
