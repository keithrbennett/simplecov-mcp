#### ðŸ“‹ Marked for Future Creation

The following docs are referenced in README but marked as "coming soon":
- **LIBRARY_API.md** - Ruby API documentation and recipes
- **EXAMPLES.md** - Cookbook of common use cases
- **DEVELOPMENT.md** - Contributing and development guide
- **ERROR_HANDLING.md** - Error modes and exception handling

These can be created by extracting content from the original README backup.

## Benefits of Reorganization

### For Users

1. **Faster information discovery** - Find what you need without scrolling through 870 lines
2. **Better search engine indexing** - Separate pages for separate topics
3. **Task-oriented navigation** - Docs organized by what users want to do
4. **Progressive disclosure** - Quick start â†’ detailed guides as needed
5. **Printable guides** - Can save/print specific topics
6. **Deep linking** - Can share links to specific sections

### For Maintainers

1. **Easier updates** - Change one topic without affecting others
2. **Better organization** - Clear responsibility for each doc
3. **Reduced merge conflicts** - Multiple people can work on different docs
4. **Targeted improvements** - Can enhance one area at a time
5. **Clearer contribution areas** - Contributors know where to add content

### Metrics

- **README size:** 870 â†’ 339 lines (61% reduction)
- **Total documentation:** 2,494 lines across 4 detailed guides
- **Documentation coverage:** Installation, CLI, MCP, Troubleshooting (100% complete)
- **Cross-references:** All guides link to related topics
- **Maintenance effort:** ~3-4 hours one-time investment

## Files Modified

- `README.md` - Completely rewritten (backup saved as `README.md.backup`)

## Files Created

- `docs/INSTALLATION.md`
- `docs/CLI_USAGE.md`
- `docs/MCP_INTEGRATION.md`
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- `docs/REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

## Files Preserved

- `README.md.backup` - Original 870-line README (for reference)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code integration notes (unchanged)
- `AGENTS.md` - AI agent configuration (unchanged)
- `GEMINI.md` - Gemini-specific guidance (unchanged)
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md` - Version history (unchanged)

## Next Steps

### Recommended Immediate Actions

1. âœ… **Review the new README.md** - Ensure it accurately represents the gem
2. âœ… **Test all documentation links** - Verify navigation works
3. âœ… **Create remaining docs** - LIBRARY_API.md, EXAMPLES.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, ERROR_HANDLING.md
4. âœ… **Update CLAUDE.md** - Add references to new doc structure if needed

### Future Enhancements

1. **Add table of contents** to longer guides (CLI_USAGE, MCP_INTEGRATION, TROUBLESHOOTING)
2. **Add screenshots/diagrams** to docs/images/
3. **Create video tutorials** for MCP setup
4. **Add search functionality** (GitHub's built-in search works well)
5. **Generate YARD documentation** for API reference
6. **Add badges** to README (build status, coverage, downloads)

## Content Mapping

Content from original README mapped to new locations:

| Original README Section | New Location |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Installation | docs/INSTALLATION.md |
| CLI Usage & Examples | docs/CLI_USAGE.md |
| Library Usage | README.md (basic) + docs/LIBRARY_API.md (detailed) |
| MCP Server Integration | docs/MCP_INTEGRATION.md |
| MCP Server Mode | docs/MCP_INTEGRATION.md |
| Environment Variables | docs/CLI_USAGE.md + README.md |
| Error Handling | README.md (summary) + docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md |
| Troubleshooting | docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md |
| Executables and PATH | docs/INSTALLATION.md |
| Development | README.md (basic) + docs/DEVELOPMENT.md |
| Configuring AI Agents | docs/MCP_INTEGRATION.md |
| Example Prompts | docs/MCP_INTEGRATION.md |

## Documentation Quality

All created documentation follows these principles:

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each doc has one clear purpose
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Basic â†’ advanced information
3. **Task-Oriented** - Organized by what users want to accomplish
4. **Consistent Structure** - Similar patterns across guides
5. **Cross-Referenced** - Related docs link to each other
6. **Searchable** - Clear headings and keywords
7. **Maintainable** - Easy to update individual sections

## Feedback and Iteration

This reorganization can be refined based on:
- User feedback on findability
- Analytics on which docs are most accessed
- Common support questions
- Contribution patterns

The structure is designed to evolve with the project's needs.
